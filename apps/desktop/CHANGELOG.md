# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tunno Desktop project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- 🎨 **Fullscreen Player Transition**: Resolved a visual "rainbow" artifact during background
  transitions in the fullscreen player. This fix implements a cross-fade animation, ensuring smooth
  and natural color shifts between different album art palettes without inconsistent intermediate
  states. ([#1](https://github.com/ItsLhuis/Tunno/issues/1))

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Duplicate Songs Issue**: Resolved a bug where songs were duplicated in the project's data
  folder during the fast upload process.

### Changed

- 🔧 **Internal Refactoring**: Streamlined the track processing logic by decoupling file-saving
  operations.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- 🎬 **Fullscreen player auto-hide controls**: Controls now automatically hide when the mouse is
  inactive in fullscreen mode for a cleaner, more immersive viewing experience. Move the mouse to
  reveal controls with smooth fade animations
