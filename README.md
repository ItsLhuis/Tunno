# Tunno

**Tunno** is a complete ecosystem for managing, organizing, and listening to your personal music library—anywhere, on your terms. Tunno empowers you with modern tools to download, organize, play, and synchronize your music collection across all your devices, giving you full control over your music.

## Why Tunno?

Most streaming services limit your control over your own music. Tunno is built for music lovers who want true ownership: you decide what to download, how to organize, and where to listen—without being locked into closed platforms.

## How does it work?

Tunno is made up of three main applications, each playing a key role in the ecosystem:

- **CLI**: A command-line tool for downloading music from YouTube, enriching metadata via Spotify, processing album covers, and organizing files locally. Perfect for building and maintaining your collection with precision and automation.
- **Desktop**: An application for organizing, playing, and managing your music library on your computer. Import music downloaded with the CLI, create playlists, mark favorites, edit information, and more—all in one place.
- **Mobile**: An app to access and listen to your library on the go. Sync your music with the desktop app manually or automatically by connecting both apps, so your collection is always with you.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Music Management**: Add, edit, organize, and remove songs, albums, artists, and playlists. Manage favorites, play counts, and playback history.
- **Listen Anywhere**: Enjoy your music on desktop or mobile, with seamless playback, favorites, and detailed listening stats.
- **Playlists & Favorites**: Create custom playlists and mark songs, albums, and artists as favorites for quick access.
- **Smart Downloading**: Download songs and playlists from YouTube, with rich metadata powered by Spotify integration.
- **Device Sync**: Keep your library in sync between desktop and mobile, either manually or automatically when both apps are connected.
- **Full Data Ownership**: All your data is stored locally and remains under your control—portable, private, and secure.
